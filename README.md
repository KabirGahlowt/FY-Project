# 🔍 Job Recommendation System for Daily Paid Workers (MERN + ML)

This project is a full-stack job portal designed to help clients (households, small businesses, NGOs, etc.) discover and hire **blue-collar and pink-collar workers** such as electricians, maids, drivers, and cooks. The system includes support for **offline workers**, **ML-based worker recommendations**, and **role-based access** for clients, workers, and admins.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional job portals in India mainly target white-collar workers or short-term gig services. However, there is a major gap for **long-term employment opportunities** for unskilled or semi-skilled workers. This system is designed to **connect such workers with relevant employers**, even when the workers are not digitally connected.
